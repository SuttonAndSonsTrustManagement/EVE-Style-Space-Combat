# EVE-Style-Space-Combat
Advanced EVE-Style Space Combat is a single-player space combat game built using Pygame. Inspired by the dynamic and deep gameplay of titles like EVE Online, this project offers a rich, feature-packed experience that blends fast-paced action with strategic elements.
Key Features:

Interactive Start Screen:

Clickable text box for entering your name.

Mouse-clickable "Play" button to launch the game.

Mode selection via keyboard (Standard vs. 75% Less Aggressive).

Intense Space Combat:

Realistic inertia-based spaceship movement and continuous firing (with a faster fire mode when holding the spacebar).

AI-driven enemy ships with two distinct types (Chasers and Snipers) whose behavior adapts based on the chosen game mode.

Advanced Defensive Mechanics:

Deployable force fields that last 20 secondsâ€”first 5 activations are free, with later activations costing tokens.

Tokens can be earned by scoring kills, with special rewards for destroying green enemies.

Support Systems:

AI-controlled drones that assist in combat.

Wave-based enemy spawning for progressively challenging gameplay.

Persistent High Scores:

High scores are saved in an SQLite database and displayed on the start screen.

This project demonstrates advanced game development techniques in Python, covering real-time action, AI behavior, interactive UI elements, and persistent data management. It's ideal for anyone looking to explore the possibilities of Pygame and create engaging, feature-rich games.
